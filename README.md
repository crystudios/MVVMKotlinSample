# MVVMKotlinSample
### AndroidVPN

Sample project showcasing MVVM Pattern in a Kotlin Android App

This app was made as a test project for a company, This project was developed as a test project and the APIs used are now down so the app won't run.

The goal of this task was basically to measure my ability to follow strict design and implementation instructions. i's a simple 2 screens app that i did in less than 2 days. it consist of two screens:

1. A splash screen with an animation while downloading data from a server, and verifying the user's location and closest "servers"

2. A tabbed screen that holds a list of all servers (free / vip) on each tab.

Screenshots of the working app are shown below:
